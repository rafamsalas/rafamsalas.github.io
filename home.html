    Well, welcome to my site. Not much to look at, at the moment. I'll be able to place more content soon, just need to find out exactly what to have in here. So far, this is going to be a collection of all my projects that I've been doing here at YWebCA. I'll have more projects, both prior to YWebCA and after it.
    I guess I might as well have stuff that I like or find interesting. Really, all of this text is a placeholder right now, but hopefully I'll have some relevant content here.
