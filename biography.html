      <p class="bio">Yeah, this doesn't seem like the greatest idea; putting a lot of your information out on teh internetz. Not only is the fact that I can be doxxed and have my password figured out pretty quickly,
        but the fact that I also don't have any clue as to who is actually seeing this stuff. Anyways, I'll be as descriptive and informative about my life and whatnot without any major risk of releasing too much information because I'm rather paranoid with this kind of stuff.
         So without further ado, I'll submit my little trickle of information into the bottomless ocean of stuff in the Internet.
        <br>In West Phildelphia born and rai- just messing with you. From Oaxaca, Mexico, my family moved to Madison, Wisconsin when I was less than three years old. I've been in the Madison area ever since, so I guess I could consider myself as a native Wisconsinite and Madisonian, but I sometimes don't really feel that way.
        Anyways, I was brought up in very different setting and environment, in terms of education. I was in a primarily white school district, although I really didn't seem to notice it, whether I wanted to or not. Since I was in a bilingual class my whole elementary years, I didn't seem to focus much on race disparity in my class. That and because of the innocence and naïvety I had as a kid. I was much more aware of race as soon as I went to middle grade. I noticed I was usually the only Latin@ or even minority student in many of my classes.
