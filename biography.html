      <p class="bio">Yeah, this doesn't seem like the greatest idea; putting a lot of your information out on teh internetz. Not only is the fact that I can be doxxed and have my password figured out pretty quickly,
        but the fact that I also don't have any clue as to who is actually seeing this stuff. Anyways, I'll be as descriptive and informative about my life and whatnot without any major risk of releasing too much information because I'm rather paranoid with this kind of stuff.
         So without further ado, I'll submit my little trickle of information into the bottomless ocean of stuff in the Internet.
        <br>In West Phildelphia born and rai- just messing with you. From Oaxaca, Mexico, my family moved to Madison, Wisconsin when I was less than three years old. I've been in the Madison area ever since, so I guess I could consider myself as a native Wisconsinite and Madisonian, but I sometimes don't really feel that way.
        Anyways, I was brought up in very different setting and environment, in terms of education. I was in a primarily white school district, although I really didn't seem to notice it, whether I wanted to or not. Since I was in a bilingual class my whole elementary years, I didn't seem to focus much on race disparity in my class.
        That and because of the innocence and naïvety I had as a kid. I was much more aware of race as soon as I went to middle grade. I noticed I was usually the only Latin@ or even minority student in many of my classes.
        I felt either awkward or alone since I didn't seem to relate with many people in class. During this time, though I also was beginning to learn more about myself.<br>
        I soon became intersted in music, mostly since I've had a rather musical family. During middle school, I learned how to play guitar, bass, trumpet, and other instruments. I found myself really liking playing music, since it kinda gave me a time for relaxation and development. I also became very interested in computers, specifically on the hardware side of them.
        I began to mess with some computers and even took parts out of old desktop towers, almost breaking laptops, and just learning about computer hardware by myself. Soon enough I found myself interested in computer programming and web development. Around seventh grade, I did some courses in Codecademy for HTML and CSS, although it didn't seem to be as in depth as I wanted it to be.
        As I got into high school, I took several courses that revolved around computers, both the more interactive, inputting things in a program and the tinkering with computer stuff. In my freshman year, I excelled (heh) in Excel, began to blog (although it was nothing that I wanted in terms of content), and messed around with LEDs and breadboards. In my sophomore year,
        I got annoyed with Scratch, create mini-games in GameMaker, construct maps in Blender, walk around with a rubber chicken using the Unity Engine, and making ethernet cables for our pimped out computers with i5 3450s clocked at 3.4 GHz (the room was like a jet engine; I feel bad for the stock coolers), Radeon 5670 (at least they weren't 5650s) and 400W PSU (yeah, OC'ing those i5s were not a good idea).
        During my junior year, I worked with even more Scratch, learned to hate Visual Basic with a passion, learned some Java, and built even more computers. During my time at high school, I also became more involved in community work. I can honestly say, (not joking at all, not kidding), that I do care for my community and for my people, even if it sounds super cheesy and stupid.
        I've been at several community events and organizations that have strived to create a better community here in Madison. I've been part in mulitple groups that are advocating education among minorities and a better community inside of our schools.
