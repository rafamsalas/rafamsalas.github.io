          <h3>Current Main Project</h3>
          <article>
          <p>Right now, my biggest "project", so to speak, is to finish up the <a href="http://ywebca.org/">YWebCA</a>, a web development program offered by the YWCA of Madison, Wisconsin.
           The program is an 11 week boot camp for web development, were students learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery while learning the basics of creating a website from the ground up.</p>

          <h3>Newest Project</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Recently, myself and friends of mine, with a collaboration with the school districts of Madison, Middleton, and Verona, and with help of the Centro Hispano of Madison, have created a new project that we call "<strong>La [Re]Generacíon</strong>", which is a <a href="http://www.practicingfreedom.org/offerings/participatory-action-research/">Youth-Led Participatory Action Research</a>, in which Latin@ students will be able to conduct surveys and make thier own research on
            how the Latino community here in Madison is doing, diagnose what problems are and are persisting in our community, obtain data and information, being able to present that data in any way possible, through art, info-graphs, collective essays, and to create solutions
            that we are then able to apply and achieve later on. It is a very early and time consuming project, but in the end it will be much well worth the effort to do so.</p>

          <h3>Older Projects and Works</h3>
          <article>
          <p>I've been doing a lot of projects and works for the past 4 or so years. I consider myself a very novice <a href = "http://i.imgur.com/TIxkpir.jpg">photographer</a>, just taking picture either on a <a href = "http://i.imgur.com/0ewYVSe.jpg">camera</a> I have at home or with my <a href = "">phone</a> ( real photographers, please don't kill me). I also work with a lot of music, creating, writing, playing and spreading the word for <a href="http://www.olmecaone.com/">underground artists</a>.
          I've had the honor to be have talked with several upcoming artists from the underground scene. Recently, I've taken up on graphical rendering and video editing as well. I'll post some more content soon.</p>
