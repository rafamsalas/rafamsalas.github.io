      <p class="welcome-text">There's not much to say about me, other than the fact that I'm a bit of an autodict and a dick.
        <br> I tend to be relatively to myself until I'm either forced to talk or I do want to talk, with the former being the more likely outcome.
        <br> I have a broad amount of interests and favorites. I have a rather diverse taste in music, ranging to folklore music from various cultures to Viking Metal to heavy rock to underground hip-hop. I like to play several video games, prmarily Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
         I have a knack with messing around with computer hardware and also enjoy to figure out problems.
